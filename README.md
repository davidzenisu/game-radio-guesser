# game-radio-guesser
Small website that let's you guess a song's release decade for songs currently playing on radio stations.

This repository was refactored into a small React app (Vite) that uses the RadioBrowser and MusicBrainz public APIs to scan stations and try to find songs from a randomly selected decade.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
